# [Typst Preview VSCode](https://github.com/Enter-tainer/typst-preview)

Preview your Typst files in vscode instantly!

## Features

- Low latency preview: preview your document instantly on type. The incremental rendering technique makes the preview latency as low as possible.
- Open in browser: open the preview in browser, so you put it in another monitor. https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/1344
- Cross jump between code and preview: We implement SyncTeX-like feature for typst-preview. You can now click on the preview panel to jump to the corresponding code location, and vice versa.

Install this extension from [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgt19937.typst-preview), open command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), and type `>Typst Preview:`.

You can also use the shortcut (Ctrl+K V).

## Bug report

To achieve high performance instant preview, we use a **different rendering backend** from official typst. We are making our best effort to keep the rendering result consistent with official typst. We have set up comprehensive tests to ensure the consistency of the rendering result. But we cannot guarantee that the rendering result is the same in all cases. There can be unknown corner cases that we haven't covered.

**Therefore, if you encounter any rendering issue, please report it to this repo other than official typst repo.**

### v0.5.1

- Performance improvement(#14): We now use typst.ts. We utilize a  [virtual DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_DOM) approach to diff and render the document. This is a **significant enhancement** of previewing document in `onType` mode in terms of resource savings and response time for changes.
- Cross jump between code and preview (#36): We implement SyncTeX-like feature for typst-preview. You can now click on the preview panel to jump to the corresponding code location, and vice versa. This feature is still experimental and may not work well in some cases. Please report any issues you encounter.

- Open preview in separate window(#39): You can type `typst-preview.browser` in command palette to open the preview page in a separate browser.
- Links in preview panel: You can now click on links in the preview panel to open them in browser. The cross reference links are also clickable.

- Fix #60 and #24. Now we watch dirty files in memory therefore no shadow file is needed. Due to the removal of disk read/write, this should also improve performance and latency.
- Preview on type is now enabled by default for new users. Existing users will not be affected.

- Bug fixes:
  - #79: We now put typst compiler and renderer in a dedicate thread. Therefore we should get more stable performance.

  - #81: We now use a more robust way to detect the whether to kill stale server process. This should fix the problem where the when preview tab will become blank when it becomes inactive for a while.
  - #87: Add enum description for `typst-preview.scrollSync`. Previously the description is missing.
